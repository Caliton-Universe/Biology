##### Where does "Biology" Come From

The word biology is derived from the greek words **bios** meaning life and **logos** meaning **study** and is defined as the science of life and living organisms. An organism is a living entity consisting of one cell.

**e.g.** bacteria, or several cells e.g. animals, plants and fungi.

##### History of Overall Biology

“Biology is defined as the study of living organisms, their origins, anatomy, morphology, physiology, behaviour, and distribution.”

The History of Biology, focuses on the advent of life on earth, right from the ancient times. Biological discoveries have a remarkable impact on the human society. Traditionally, the history of biology is diversified into two wings – studies on medicine and theories of natural history. Medicines are not results of current biological discoveries.
